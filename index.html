Vexor Privacy Policy
Last Updated: April 24, 2025

Summary: Vexor is built with privacy at its core. We don't collect your data, your wallet private keys remain on your device, and we don't track your browsing or transaction activity.

Introduction
Vexor ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use our Chrome extension.

Information Collection
We do not collect or transmit any of your personal data to our servers. All user data, including:

Wallet private keys
Transaction history
Portfolio information
Security settings and PIN codes
User preferences
remains stored locally on your device using Chrome's secure storage mechanisms and is never transmitted to any remote servers controlled by us.

External Services
Vexor connects to the following external services:

Blockchain RPC endpoints (Ethereum, PulseChain, BSC, Base) to execute transactions and verify contract information
Price data providers (such as DexScreener) to display token values
Blockchain explorers to verify contract details
These connections are made solely to retrieve necessary data for the extension's functionality. When connecting to these services, only the minimum information required to process your requests (such as wallet addresses for balance checks or contract addresses for verification) is transmitted.

Local Storage
Vexor uses your browser's local storage mechanisms to maintain:

Your wallet information (including encrypted private keys)
Your active wallet selection
Security configuration including PIN protection settings
Lists of purchased and removed tokens
User interface preferences
This data remains on your device and persists between browser sessions to provide a seamless experience.

Security Measures
We take several measures to protect your data:

Automatic security locking when tabs become inactive
Optional PIN code protection for sensitive areas of the extension
Local-only storage of sensitive information
Permissions Required
Vexor requires several Chrome permissions to function properly:

Storage: To save your wallet information and preferences locally
ActiveTab: To detect contract addresses on webpages you visit
Tabs: For security features and cross-tab communication
Scripting: To scan dynamic content and add interactive elements
Host Permissions: To connect to blockchain services and price APIs
Analytics and Tracking
Vexor does not include any analytics or tracking systems. We do not monitor your usage of the extension, the websites you visit, or the transactions you perform.

Children's Privacy
Vexor is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
